## Suicide survival
Suicide Survival is a modification of Half-Life 2 Deathmatch.
There are two teams. You either play as an overweight WW2 pilot in the survivor team or as a suicider disguised as a pot plant in the suicider team.
The goal for the survivors is to stay alive and to spot the suiciders. They have a couple of throw-able copies of the book: “Gardening for Beginners – by Barbara Bush” as a self-defense weapon.
The goal for suiciders is to sneak up close enough to the survivors in order to blow themselves up. Because each map is full of shrubberies its very hard to spot a real suicidal pot plant among the many fake ones. If a shrubbery isn’t moving, you can’t tell if he is being controlled by another player or not.
Currently the game doesn’t have any other goal then being simple team deathmatch. However it still is a lot of fun and you should definitely try it out with a few friends.
  

**NOTE**
Development on this game has stopped a long time ago, this WINE implementation is not fully stable.
If the server does not complete its starting sequence, just restart it untill it works. Happens personally about 25% of the time.
Custom maps can be downloaded [on the official website](http://suicide-survival.com/sv_download/maps/).
