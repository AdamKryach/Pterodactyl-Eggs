# Neos vr headless client / server beta
## From https://neos.com
Developing Neos, short for neo spatium - new space, a highly collaborative virtual and augmented reality metaverse.

# Notice

To use this egg you will need a beta code and an alt steam account with steam guard disabled the account will also need to have neos vr in its library. You can do this by running app_license_request 740250 in steamcmd if you have never installed neos on this account
For more information related too configuration go here: https://wiki.neos.com/Headless_Client/Server

This game does not require any port forwarding but instead uses udp whole punching on a random port. You can force a certain port in the config. I was using host networking so I didn't have any problems with this.
