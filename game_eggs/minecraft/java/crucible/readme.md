# Crucible

This is a custom Egg for the server with Plugins & Mods for 1.7.10

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |

## Notes
By default the downloaded version is `4.5`, versions must follow the pattern `x.x` or `staging-XXXXX` for branch builds
