# BungeeCord Server

This Pterodactyl Egg sets up a BungeeCord server, a lightweight proxy designed to facilitate communication between multiple Minecraft servers.

## Server Ports
Typically, a BungeeCord server requires a single port for access (default 25565). However, additional ports may need to be opened depending on the plugins and configurations of your Minecraft network.

| Port  | Default |
