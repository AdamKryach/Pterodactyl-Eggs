# MCDReforged

MCDReforged (abbreviated as MCDR) is a tool which provides the management ability of the Minecraft server using custom plugin system. It doesn't need to modify or mod the original Minecraft server at all

## Server Ports

The minecraft server requires a single port for access (default 25565) but plugins may require extra ports to enabled for the server.

| Port  | default |
|-------|---------|
| Game  | 25565   |

## declaration

The script part refers to paper Egg, because only MCDReforged cannot be used normally, and a server is required.
