# Wargame: Red Dragon - patched

#### Wargame: Red Dragon patched dedicated server


#### from the developers

Wargame: Red Dragon is thrilling in single-player mode with its new dynamic campaign system, and also offers an extensive multiplayer mode where up to 20 players can compete against each other simultaneously.

##### Patch

One of the problems for the Wargame community is that there are some missing features for servers -- vote to kick, vote to rotate map, broadcast server rules, see stats about average strength of both teams compared, etc. The applied patch adds this functionality.
