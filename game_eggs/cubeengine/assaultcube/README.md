# AssaultCube
[assault.cubers.net](https://assault.cubers.net/)
AssaultCube is a FREE, multiplayer, first-person shooter game, based on the CUBE engine.

Taking place in realistic environments, with fast, arcade gameplay, it's addictive and fun!

With efficient bandwidth usage, it's low-latency and can even run over a 56 Kbps connection.
It's tiny too, weighing in at a lightweight about 50 MB package available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
On the correct settings, it can even run on old hardware (Pentium III and above).

## AssaultCube requires 2 CONSECUTIVE Ports!
When selecting a port, the assaultcube server will use the exact next consecutive port of the game port.
So if you give the server port 25510, the server will also need 25511.
The second port is only used for the server master list to be able to update the server info. (Description, player count, etc.)
