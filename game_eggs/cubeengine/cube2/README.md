# Cube 2: Sauerbraten
[sauerbraten.org](http://sauerbraten.org/)

Cube 2: Sauerbraten is a free multiplayer & singleplayer first person shooter, the successor of the Cube FPS.
Much like the original Cube, the aim of this game is fun, old school deathmatch gameplay and also to allow map/geometry editing to be done cooperatively in-game.

## Cube 2: Sauerbraten requires 2 CONSECUTIVE Ports!
When selecting a port, the cube server will use the exact next consecutive port of the game port.
So if you give the server port 25510, the server will also need 25511.
The second port is only used for the server master list to be able to update the server info. (Description, player count, etc.)
