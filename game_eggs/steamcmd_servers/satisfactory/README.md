# Satisfactory
Satisfactory is a first-person open-world factory building game with a dash of exploration and combat. 
Play alone or with friends, explore an alien planet, create multi-story factories, and enter conveyor belt heaven!

**NOTE**
The game does not yet have an official dedicated server. So there are no admin commands or similar configuration options available.
Also, the server is always public and cannot be secured with a password.

## Game Infos
### Steam Guardcode
To download the base game, you will need to authenticate against Steam. Because of the normally active Steamgaurd protection, it is important to enter the Steamgaurd code. 
Once the initial installation is complete, you will need to enter the Steamguard code that will be emailed to you and then reinstall the server.

This will only work if you receive Steamguard codes via mail. The Authenticator app is not supported.

### Mods
To use mods, you have to install the Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML) first. The egg could automatically 
insstall it for you.
Mods could be found [here](https://ficsit.app/). Only modded clients can join a modded server.

### First start
When starting the server, a game is automatically createt. 
When joining the first time, you have to reconnect to the server. Otherwise, you can get stuck in the onboarding intro and cannot dismantle the landing pod.

### Host player
When starting the game, there is always a Host player spwaned at the landing pod/hub. And after each restart, another host player is added.
So after many restarts, the hub can become quite full.
Probably these host corpses can be removed via the SavegameEditor, should they disturb at some point.
