## Install notes

As of 07.11.2023 there isnâ€™t a dedicated server branch like there was for CS:GO (740).<br>
The server files are included inside the game files (730).<br>

## Installation/System Requirements

The following system requirements are not confirmed yet.<br>
While installing the server it uses up to 5 GB of RAM.<br>

|  | Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Processor | 1.4 GHz processor (64-bit) | 2.8 GHz processor (64-bit) |
| RAM | 2 GB | 5 GB |
| Storage | 35 GB | 50 GB |
| Network | 1 Mbit/s | 5 Mbit/s |

## Server Ports

The default game server port for CS2 is 27015 but any other port can be used.<br>
For the use of SourceTV you need to allocate a second port, the default one for this is 27020 but any other port can be used.<br>
By default SourceTV is disabled in srctv.cfg. Please keep in mind that the use of SourceTV might cause in higher CPU and RAM usage!<br>

## Notes

The default server.cfg is empty, so i added a very basic autoexec.cfg to this repository, which is is executed at startup.<br>
As of October 5th 2023 RCON is not working correctly or is bugged when joining the server.<br>
You need to use the server console or external rcon tool to be able to execute rcon commands. This might be fixed in a future update.<br>
