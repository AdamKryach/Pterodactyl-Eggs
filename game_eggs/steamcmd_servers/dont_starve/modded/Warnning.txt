!!! Warning: Game Exit Procedure !!!
 
Attention:
Due to a design limitation of the game, it cannot exit gracefully using standard Linux signals.
 
For a graceful shutdown, please follow these steps:
1. Use the 'fg caves' and 'fg master' commands to access each shard's process within supervisorctl.
2. Manually type 'c_shutdown()' in each process to initiate a graceful shutdown.
 
After completing the manual shutdown, you can safely click the 'stop' button or type 'exit' to exit supervisorctl.
