# SCP: Secret Laboratory
### From their [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/SCP_Secret_Laboratory/):
Deep within the SCP Foundation during a containment breach, many of the anomalies have bypassed security and escaped from their chambers - without peaceful intentions. Become site personnel, a re-containment agent, or an anomalous entity and fight to take control of or escape the facility!

### Requirements
- 4GB+ RAM
- Relatively powerful CPU

### Preinstalled modifications:
- [MultiAdmin](https://github.com/Grover-c13/MultiAdmin) - MultiAdmin is a replacement server tool for SCP: Secret Laboratory, which was built to help enable servers to have multiple configurations per server instance. It also adds extra console commands and management features.
- [ServerMod2](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/) - ServerMod2 is a server side plugin system with a bunch of additional configuration options, bug fixes, security patches and some optimisations built in. [SMOD Wiki](https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/wiki)

Both modifications download the latest versions of themselves directly from GitHub whenever the server is installed.

### Configuration File Locations:
Under servers/server/ there are 3 configuration files, all set to their default values:
- config_gameplay.txt
- config_remoteadmin.txt
- scp_multiadmin.cfg
