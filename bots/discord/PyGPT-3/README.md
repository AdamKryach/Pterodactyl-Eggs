**Please do not** create an issue in this, the parkervcp eggs repo, or ask for help in the Pterodactyl Discord for more than basic setup questions.
If you do need help understanding the environmental variables or with basic setup you can ask in the custom game help channel
in the Pterodactyl Discord or send the maintainer of PyGPT-3 a message, but it's preferred that you open
an issue in the PyGPT-3 Github so that the maintainer knows to update the documentation to clarify the matter you're struggling with.
