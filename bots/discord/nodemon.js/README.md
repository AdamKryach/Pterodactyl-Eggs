# nodemon.js

Tired of manually restarting your bot? Nodemon will do it by itself.

Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

Nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development.
