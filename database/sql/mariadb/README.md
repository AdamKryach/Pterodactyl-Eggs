# MariaDB
### From their [Website](https://mariadb.org/)
One of the most popular database servers. Made by the original developers of MySQL.  
Guaranteed to stay open source. 

### Minimum RAM warning
MariaDB doesn't have minimal hardware requirements per se, or if there was any, it would correspond to pre-2000 machines which don't exist anymore. So it mostly depends on what you intend to do with it. Tarball is approximately 400MB, by my last count. Packages are much less than that.

### Server Ports
Ports required to run the server in a table format.
